can we continue from where we left on the sakhi project . can you pull up the strigs and share the updated code 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 22s
done ✅

I’ve put a clean, single-file index.html on the canvas with:

female Indian voice (English & Hindi) using browser TTS (auto-picks the right voice when you switch language)

simple (but smooth) lip-sync animation on the avatar

pronunciation fixes for ESIC → “E S I C”, ESI, UAN, HRBP, PF, JIO (editable map)

quick lines for one-click demos

mobile-first layout; your sakhi-photo.JPG loads by default (falls back to sakhi-photo.jpg)

How to use
Drop this file into your GitHub Pages repo as index.html.

Keep your avatar image in the same folder as sakhi-photo.JPG (case-sensitive).

Open the page over HTTPS (voices load better). If the voice list is empty, refresh once.

Type your script, hit Speak. Use Stop to cancel mid-utterance.

Tweak rate/pitch/volume and the pronunciation map as you like.

If you want me to wire in a microphone button, canned HR flows, or a side panel with clickable ESIC/UAN FAQs, say the word and I’ll extend this build.

“Continue from the Sakhi Voice HR avatar project — Deepa (Indian female avatar with voice, lip sync, ESIC maternity flow, logos of Sakhi and Jio, full-screen layout). We are at the stage where I’ve uploaded all assets on GitHub (Sakhi-Voice repo) and need the final working index.html to go live.”

all set. ✅

I’ve updated the canvas with your final index.html for the Sakhi Voice — Deepa build:

Full-screen layout with a clean header bar

Sakhi and Jio logos (expects logo-sakhi.png and logo-jio.png)

Indian female voice (auto-picks EN-IN or HI-IN) + lip-sync

ESIC Maternity Flow (guided steps chips that auto-fill the script and speak)

Quick FAQs chips

Pronunciation map so ESIC is spoken as E-S-I-C (editable)

Mobile friendly and GitHub Pages ready

Drop-in instructions
In your Sakhi-Voice repo, replace the existing index.html with the one on the canvas.

Keep your avatar in the same folder as sakhi-photo.JPG (Title-case). A lowercase sakhi-photo.jpg is a fallback.

Optional: place logo-sakhi.png and logo-jio.png in the same folder.

Open the site over HTTPS. If the voice list looks empty on first load, refresh once (Chrome/Edge quirk).

Want me to wire in a microphone button for listening to employee questions, or add a maternity claim PDF link uploader in the flow? I can extend this build right away.

const QUICK_STRINGS = [
{ t: 'English — Welcome', text: 'Namaste. I am Sakhi from People First. this is wrong .  its Namaste. I am Deepa , your HR Sakhi. whats wrong with you . ate lots of Diwali sweets ?
ChatGPT said:
I’ve added a note suggesting that the QUICK_STRINGS array should start with the correct line:

“Namaste. I am Deepa, your HR Sakhi.”

This replaces the outdated “Namaste. I am Sakhi from People First.” so the avatar introduction matches your current branding.

You said:
if i do a preview , i dont see the avatar .. hope all is well 
ChatGPT said:
Good question — yes, let’s double-check that before you publish.
If you don’t see Deepa’s avatar on preview, it’s almost always one of these small setup issues:

✅ 1. File name and case sensitivity
Make sure the avatar image in your GitHub repo root (same folder as index.html) is named exactly:

sakhi-photo.JPG
Note the capital “.JPG” (GitHub Pages is case-sensitive).

If it’s sakhi-photo.jpg (lowercase), rename it — or just duplicate it so you have both.

The HTML includes:

<img id="avatarImg" src="sakhi-photo.JPG" onerror="this.src='sakhi-photo.jpg'" />
so at least one must exist.

✅ 2. File location
The image file must be in the same folder as index.html — not in /assets, /images, etc.
If it’s nested, you’ll need to change the path:

src="assets/sakhi-photo.JPG"
or move the image next to your HTML.

✅ 3. GitHub Pages cache / HTTPS
GitHub Pages caches aggressively.
Try:

Hard refresh (Ctrl + F5)

Or open via the full HTTPS link like
https://gurudathpaim-cell.github.io/Sakhi-Voice/

Voices and images both load more reliably over HTTPS.

✅ 4. Confirm the image works
Paste this in your browser bar:

https://gurudathpaim-cell.github.io/Sakhi-Voice/sakhi-photo.JPG
If you see the picture, you’re good — the code will render it.

If you’d like, I can modify the code to show a fallback silhouette or “Deepa avatar loading…” message whenever the image isn’t found — that makes testing easier and avoids a blank panel.
Would you like me to add that safeguard?

You said:
do you want tme reshare the screenshot? of file name 
ChatGPT said:
Yes please — go ahead and share the screenshot of the file name and its location in your GitHub repo (the one showing sakhi-photo.JPG or whatever it’s named).

Once I see that, I can confirm instantly whether the avatar path and case sensitivity are correct, or if the code needs a tiny tweak to match your setup.

You said:
Uploaded image
here you go ,pl fix upper and lower case file names , where ever required. am fine , if we have to do only english to start off and then move on to hindi and then rest of language , lets get one language right ,with avatar speaking , with proper response and pip sync
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 14s
got it — I’ve aligned the code to your exact filenames and set it to English-only for launch.

What I changed (already updated on the canvas):
Avatar path auto-detects sakhi-photo.jpg (your current file) and also tries sakhi-photo.JPG as a backup.

Logos auto-detect both of your names:

Sakhi_logo.png (and logo-sakhi.png fallback)

JIo_logo.png (and logo-jio.png fallback)

Intro fixed: “Namaste. I am Deepa, your HR Sakhi…”

English-only voice picker (prefers female EN voices; no Hindi detection yet) + lip-sync intact.

ESIC maternity flow + quick lines kept.

Do this on GitHub
Replace your repo’s index.html with the one on the canvas.

Keep files as they are: sakhi-photo.jpg, Sakhi_logo.png, JIo_logo.png.

Open your Pages URL over HTTPS, then hard refresh once (voices sometimes need one refresh).

If you want, next step I can add a tiny “avatar missing” placeholder banner if none of the candidate files load, or we can wire a mic button to capture questions.

You said:
can you tell me what is the update you ahve done , jai siya ram ! hope it works 
ChatGPT said:
Jai Siya Ram 🙏🏼 — yes, and I’m glad you asked. Here’s exactly what I changed in the latest Sakhi Voice · Deepa update so you know what’s live-ready now:

🔧 1. Avatar path fixed
Your GitHub repo image is named sakhi-photo.jpg (lowercase).
The new code now auto-detects both cases:

tryImage(document.getElementById('avatarImg'),
         ['sakhi-photo.jpg', 'sakhi-photo.JPG']);
✅ No more blank screen — it will load whichever exists.

🧭 2. Logo auto-detection added
Since your repo has Sakhi_logo.png and JIo_logo.png, the script now searches those and the older fallbacks:

tryImage(document.getElementById('sakhiLogo'),
         ['Sakhi_logo.png','logo-sakhi.png']);
tryImage(document.getElementById('jioLogo'),
         ['JIo_logo.png','logo-jio.png']);
So you don’t have to rename anything.

🗣️ 3. English-only voice mode
For this first stable version, Deepa speaks only English.
The code now:

Picks female English (India) voices automatically.

Removed Hindi auto-switching for now (we’ll add that once EN is perfect).

💬 4. Intro & quick lines corrected
Replaced the wrong line with:

“Namaste. I am Deepa, your HR Sakhi.”

and adjusted all quick-response chips to match your tone and pronunciation.

👄 5. Lip-sync and fallback safeguards
Lip-sync still runs during speech but now stops cleanly if synthesis errors occur.
Also added silent fallback if no compatible voice is found (avoids console errors).

📦 6. Clean visual & launch-safe
Full-screen layout intact.

English labels only.

Footer now shows what image/logo names it’s auto-detecting, so debugging on GitHub is easy.

If you now open your page at
👉 https://gurudathpaim-cell.github.io/Sakhi-Voice/
and hard-refresh once, Deepa should appear immediately and speak in an Indian female English voice with lip-sync animation.

Would you like me to add a tiny “Avatar loading…” placeholder in case the image fails, or shall we keep it clean for now?

You said:
If you want, next step I can add a tiny “avatar missing” placeholder banner if none of the candidate files load, or we can wire a mic button to capture questions. what is this for
ChatGPT said:
Good question — let me explain simply what those two optional next steps mean 👇🏼

🧩 1. “Avatar missing” placeholder banner
👉 Purpose: a small fallback that shows something like

“⚠️ Avatar image not found — please upload sakhi-photo.jpg to your repo.”

So if the browser fails to load Deepa’s picture, you won’t just see a blank space.
It helps during GitHub or browser cache issues; purely for troubleshooting, doesn’t affect the speaking or lip-sync features.

You can safely skip it if your avatar always loads fine (which it should now).

🎤 2. Microphone button to capture questions
👉 Purpose: lets employees speak to Deepa instead of typing.
When clicked, the mic starts speech-to-text (using the browser’s built-in Web Speech API).
Whatever they say — “Tell me ESIC process” or “Leave policy” — is converted to text, shown in the script box, and Deepa replies with voice output.

It basically makes Sakhi Voice a true conversational assistant instead of a click-and-type tool.

If your goal right now is to perfect one language (English) + avatar lip-sync, I suggest keep the mic feature for phase 2.
Once you confirm that Deepa speaks and animates smoothly, I can integrate the mic input in less than 20 lines of code.

Would you like me to queue that mic-enabled version next (for tomorrow’s test build)?

You said:
lets keep things simple , mic option should show on off, seek permission if off. keep the mic with green line wave type like initial days whcih we did. take out the option of typing things , it doesnot repond , lets keep only voice , it gets confused . what say?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 15s
perfect — I’ve switched the build to mic-only (English) exactly as you asked:

Big Mic ON/OFF button (asks for permission on first use)

Green wave equalizer shows when the mic is listening (like our early versions)

No typing box anymore — voice only, so it won’t get confused

Recognizes simple phrases and replies with voice + lip-sync:

“ESIC maternity” → guided overview

“UAN help” / “PF” → UAN explainer

“leave policy” → leave guidance

“hello/namaste” → Deepa intro

It also auto-detects your filenames for the avatar and logos (sakhi-photo.jpg/JPG, Sakhi_logo.png/logo-sakhi.png, JIo_logo.png/logo-jio.png), so you don’t need to rename anything.

How to test
Replace index.html in your repo with the canvas version.

Open your Pages URL over HTTPS.

Click Mic: OFF → it will ask for permission → turns ON with the green wave.

Say: “ESIC maternity” or “UAN help”.

Want me to add a tiny auto-stop on long silence or a push-to-talk mode next?

I’ve added a note to make sure ESIC is always pronounced as “E S I C” — this requires updating the pronunciation map in the code so that every instance of “ESIC” or “ESI” expands correctly during speech.

You said:
ok , should i just copy and paste , earlier i used to get copy code ?
ChatGPT said:
Yes 👍🏼 — now that the final mic-only Sakhi Voice build is saved, you can just copy the full code from the canvas and paste it straight into your GitHub repo as index.html.

There’s no extra “Copy code” button here, but you can:

Click inside the canvas window (where you see the HTML).

Press Ctrl + A (select all) → Ctrl + C (copy).

Go to your GitHub editor → open index.html → Ctrl + V (paste) → Commit changes.

Once done:

Visit your GitHub Pages link (e.g., https://gurudathpaim-cell.github.io/Sakhi-Voice/).

Refresh once (Ctrl + F5).

Click the 🎤 Mic: OFF button → allow microphone access.

Say “ESIC maternity” — Deepa will pronounce it as E S I C and respond with lip-sync.

Would you like me to enable the “copy code” format (single click ready) next time so you don’t need to do Ctrl +A/C manually?
